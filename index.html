									<p>It's been part of our daily lives that the periyar river that flows across Eloor, sometimes red, sometimes black in color, sometime over-whelmed with dead fishes makes us realize every now and then the effect of more than fifty years of what Industrialization and River sand mining had led us to. People are prone to deadly dieases, and the rate of cancer cases in the region has taken an exponential ride off lately. Where politics and people have succumbed to greediness and inactivity, some of us are seeing the glimpse of hope by protecting and preserving the almost dried-up water body around, <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/BN3fQBorXuA2">"The Ayyankulam".</a> Join us in this attempt to celebrate "WATER" , before it's too late.</p>

									<h3>The Story</h3>
									<p>Ayyankulam, has been used for both domestic as well as washing purpose from time immemorial by the people in and around Manjummel. There are a number of stories around this waterbody and its history. But for more than 20 years now because of multiple encroachements and building activities around, Ayyankulam has become unusable. Dried up and turned into a forest and wastebin with people throwing off garbage, domestic and plastic wastes into it.After years of legal battle and fights on and off the court over the land, the court has very recently issued a status quo on the land, leaving it to die. Politics, organization and people have tried to do their best over years now and often failed for the hidden agendas and greeds. <br />Shaken from the recent reports over pollution and water quality indices group of theatre artists, have taken the pledge to conserve and protect this water resource by cleaning up the space and performing a full-fledged drama at Ayyankulam. Please read more about the living condition and water issues faced by the inhabitants of Eloor-Manjummel. </p>
